# Estiven-Salazar-CE-TakeHome

### Overview

In this unit, we will learn about JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures. Specifically working with fundamental concepts we've already learned, except using them to enhance our problem-solving skills like never before!

Algorithms & Data Structures are essential to learn for when we encounter technical interviews. Understanding how we can solve the problems given to us in these interviews are essential not only attain industry positions, but to enhance our problem-solving skills.

At the beginning we cover Big O Notation, and why it is important to understand how one algorithm may be more efficient compared to another. We then step into the activities covering reversing strings & integers, palindromes, character maps, anagrams, queues, and stacks.
